/**
 * The error vocabulary: validation produces a tree of issues mirroring the
 * document's shape, and an empty tree means the document is valid.
 *
 * This shape is native to TypeScript validation libraries (compare Zod's
 * `treeifyError` and `safeParse`) rather than ported from the Python
 * reference implementation, which returns a flat list of loc-tagged
 * problems. The two are isomorphic: `flattenTree` produces the flat
 * path+kind form — the interchange format the cross-language conformance
 * corpus asserts on, and the form editor tooling needs to place a
 * diagnostic at a document location — and `treeOf` rebuilds a tree from it.
 *
 * Invariant: a subtree exists only on the path to at least one issue, so
 * `isEmptyTree` never has to search — an empty root IS the success case.
 */

 * - `invalid_value`: a value has an acceptable type but invalid content
 *   (e.g. `zarr_format: 2` in a v3 document, `order: "Q"`).
 * - `invalid_json`: bytes/text that do not decode as JSON.
